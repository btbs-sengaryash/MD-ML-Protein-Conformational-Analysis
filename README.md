Machine learning assisted analysis of protein conformational dynamics using molecular dynamics simulations and PCA.

# Machine Learning Assisted Analysis of Protein Conformational Dynamics

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with unsupervised machine learning to study the conformational dynamics of a photosynthetic protein (PDB ID: 1RWT).

The goal was to extract dominant collective motions from MD trajectories using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and interpret the resulting free energy landscape.

## Methods
- Classical molecular dynamics simulations
- Trajectory analysis (RMSD, RMSF, SASA)
- Unsupervised machine learning (PCA)
- Free energy landscape reconstruction

## Key Results
- Identification of metastable conformational states
- Low-dimensional representation of protein dynamics
- Physically meaningful free energy basins

## Tools & Technologies
- Molecular Dynamics
- Python
- NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- GROMACS
- Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation
This project was completed as a research exercise combining computational chemistry and machine learning, with an emphasis on reproducibility and scientific interpretability.
